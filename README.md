# Darkness and Light Unpacker
Unpacks .DRP game files from Darkness and Light SEA. Written in Visual Studio using C# .NET.

Currently only works for .DRP files with pure .DDS contents only. It is not able to deal with others such as 3D models or sound files
at this stage. Will work on it though.


How to Use
-----------
1. Build the .exe, download not available yet.
2. Run it and click Choose Files.
3. Select the .DRP files to unpack (multiple files supported), click Open.
4. The files will be unpacked in the same location.
